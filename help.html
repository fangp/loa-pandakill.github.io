        <h1>Welcome to Wiifan's Thaemine Trainer Tool</h1>
        <p>This Tools is very poorly made mostly using AI.</p>
        <p>To use the tool, just look at the pattern image and think where the safe zone is. Then you can click Show Answer. If your answer is correct, press Q. If your answer is wrong, press W.</p>
        <p>The goal is to hit a perfect score of 10 after 10 rounds. There is also a timer to help you track your total reaction time.</p>
        <p>The enhanced and normal patterns for the HP is not 100% accurate. For example, in a real raid, the red pattern would still be enhanced if you reach 155 HP with a non-broken stage, but this tool will say it is normal pattern. So you still might need to think twice before you decide what to do in a real raid.</p>
        <p>I can't code for shit, so feel free to make improvements to the code.</p>
